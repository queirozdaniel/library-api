# Library API

This API is to create Books and be able to borrow from them

### I'm using:
- Spring Boot version 2.5.6
- Kotlin 1.5.31
- Java 11
- I'm implementing using TDD with Mockito (maybe I to do a refactor to MockK in another branch)

#### Comments
I use suffix 'Form' for my 'DTO' input and 'VIEW' for my output. And I don't have an external library to make the mapper. :metal:
